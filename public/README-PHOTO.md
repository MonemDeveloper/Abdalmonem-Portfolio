# Profile Photo Instructions

Your photo is already set up! The website uses `myphoto.png` from this folder.

If you want to update your photo:

1. Replace the existing `myphoto.png` file in this folder (public/)
2. Keep the same name: `myphoto.png`
3. The photo should be:
   - High quality (at least 500x500 pixels)
   - Square aspect ratio (1:1)
   - Professional headshot
   - Good lighting and clear background

The website will automatically use your updated photo once you replace the file.

If no photo is found, it will use a placeholder image.
